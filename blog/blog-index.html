How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

My pair and I collaborated a bit--I had already made a wireframe and he hadn't, so I refined mine while he sketched one up.  Then we compared and discussed.  It was nice having a pair because I realized I had forgotten a nav bar, and it was nice to hear his reflections on how he uses a website (e.g. he rarely interacts with certain elements, and interacts more with others).  I was able to give him some similar feedback, and we each refined our wireframes according to our conversation.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

It's AWESOME to have a visual to look at when I have a blank text editor in front of me.  While I know I'll change a lot about this as I learn, it was really helpful to be able to look at where I'm going and start putting code on the page according to that vision.  I see it as lighter fluid--it may not be what keeps the site going, but it gets it started.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided simple was best.  He wanted to add some complex elements to his wireframe but after we discussed it, we realized that staying close to what we know (now) will make the process enjoyable.  We also decided that simplicity made sense, since the site itself is simple--no need to clutter it up!

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned about section, article, and aside!  I didn't use any sections, but I understand why I would.  I put my blog posts in article elements and my side bar in an aside (we'll see if I can figure out how to style it!)
