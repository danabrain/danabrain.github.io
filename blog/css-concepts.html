    <h1>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?</h1>

    <p>You may find yourself pondering this question as you begin to learn CSS.  It's confusing until it's not, so let me break it down for you.</p>

    <div class="post-image"><img src="../imgs/box-model.png" alt="CSS box-model"></div>

    <p>Or really, let the above image break it down for you.</p>

    <p>The CSS Box Model helps designers position elements by creating 3 means of augmenting or diminishing space.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Margin: the space around the outside of the element.  This will determine how closely it can snuggle up to other elements.</li>
      <div class="post-image"><img src="../imgs/margin.gif" alt="Margin diagram"></div>
      <li>Border: this is the line that you might draw around the element itself.  The border can be very thick, very thin, or even 0 pixels wide.  But, even if you can't see it, it's still there.</li>
      <div class="post-image"><img src="../imgs/border-width.jpg" alt="Border-width diagram"></div>
      <li>Padding:  The space between the element and the inside surface of the border.  More padding gives the element some breathing room.  Less will constrict the border close to the element itself.</li>
      <div class="post-image"><img src="../imgs/padding.png" alt="Padding diagram"></div>
    </ol>

  <p>So, when would you use each of these and why?</p>

  <p>Say you wanted to have two blocks side by side.  You might write the following code:</p>

  <div class="codeblock">
  <div class="code"><img src="../imgs/htmlcode.png"></div>
  <div class="csssnip"><img src="../imgs/csssnip.png"></div></div>
  <div>

  <p>Which would result in the following blocks:</p>

  <div class="post-image"><img src="../imgs/blocks.png" alt="Blocks"></div>


  <div class="text-box">
  <p>Not super pretty.  But they'll do the job.  So, let's change the margins so they have a little room between them.</p>

</div>

  <p>Here I've given Block 1 a margin-left of 40px (pixels).  You can see that it now bumps out past its border, and Block 2 can only come within 40px of it on the left.</p>

   <div class="post-image"><img src="../imgs/marginblocks.png" alt="Blocks"></div>


  <p>Now, for border.  I'm going to give the block different borders so you can see the effect of border width, color, and style.</p>

  <p> Block 2 has a thin, dotted, yellow border and Block 1 has a thick, solid, blue border.</p>


   <div class="post-image"><img src="../imgs/borderblocks.png" alt="Blocks"></div>

   <p>Finally, let's play with padding.  I'm going to increase the padding of Block 1 so you can see the difference.</p>

    <div class="post-image"><img src="../imgs/paddingblocks.png" alt="Blocks"></div>

    <p>Padding of 50px makes a big difference!  Here is the final CSS for the two blocks:</p>

    <div class="post-image"><img src="../imgs/finalcss.png" alt="Blocks"></div>

    <p>And there you have it, my friends.  Margins, borders, and padding.</p>
