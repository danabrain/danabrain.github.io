#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

That there's a lot to keep track of, and I still don't get floats or responsive design.  But, I feel really motivated to do the extra challenges this week (I'm stopping myself on the website at 6 hours---I really want to keep going.)  I don't know how much I learned, but I experimented a lot.  I get the feeling my CSS is super janky and would break easily, but I enjoyed toying around with it immensely.

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It's complex.  I used a fixed navbar on one page, so it was nice to get into that.  I also figured out how to float an aside--but really, if you asked me to do it again I'd struggle to tell you.  I know this is going to be a lot of learning by doing.

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I'm not sure anything was easiest--I definitely had to rely on tutorials and examples to figure out how to style the navbar, set up a background image, etc.  I still couldn't figure out how to make an entire div into a clickable link and the site is not responsive at smaller sizes.

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

That nothing exists in a vaccuum--if I change one thing in CSS, everything changes!  But it was fun to investigate and see how to make things do what I wanted them to do.
