        <h2>A Little Ruby Primer</h2>
        <p>Here is a cheat sheet to help you (and me!) remember the fundamentals of Ruby.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <div class="column-project">
    <div>
      <h2>Strings and Integers</h2>
      <p>Ruby has two powerful classes called String and Fixnum with lots of built-in power.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strings are enclosed by 'single' or "double" quotes.</li>
        <li>Strings have a number of methods, like .upcase, .reverse, and .length which are very helpful.  Full documentation of String methods can be found <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html">here.</a></li>
        <li>String characters can be accessed using bracket notation.  For example, the first character in my_string could be accessed using my_string[0].</li>
        <li>A string can be converted to an array using the .split() method (and back again to a string using .join()!)</li>
        <li>The Fixnum class contains all the operators like +, -, *, and / that you would use for basic arithmetic.</li>
        <li>The modulo (%) operator returns the remainder of a number divided by another and is helpful for creating Boolean conditionals and controlling the flow of a program.</li>
        <li>You can also check whether an integer is even or odd using .even? and .odd?.  These methods return the Boolean value of true or false.
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>Arrays are ordered sets of data that can be manipulated in a variety of helpful ways.</p>
      <li>Elements in an array are given index numbers which correspond to their order.  Index numbering starts at 0, so the first element of my_array would be accessed like so: my_array[0].</li>
      <li>There are a huge number of helpful methods you can call on arrays.  These include .length, .reverse, and .sort.  The full documentation can be found <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">here.</a></li>
      <li>Looping through an array is easy with the .each method.  This method takes a code block which it will apply to each element in the array.</li>
      <li>The power of arrays is extended even further with the Enumerable Module mixed in.  Enumberable provides a comprehensive toolkit for manipulating and iterating over arrays.  Documentation can be found <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Enumerable.html">here.</a></li>
      <li>Arrays can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional.  An array that contains arrays is called a nested array.  You can access the elements inside the inner array by using stacked indices.  my_array[2][0] would return the first element inside the third array inside my_array.</li>
      <li>Arrays have destructive methods that end with a bang: !.  These methods (like sort!) will permanently alter the original array object.  The non-destructive versions will leave the original object as it was and create a new object that has been manipulated by the given code block.</li>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Hashes</h2>
      <p>Hashes are data sets organized by key/pair values.</p>
      <li>Any object can be used as a hash key, but the most common keys are strings and symbols.</li>
      <li>Like arrays, hashes have a number of powerful methods that let the user manipulate and explore them.  Methods like has_key?, .length, and .any permit a user to peer inside the hash.  Full documentation is found <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html">here.</a></li>
      <li>Also like Arrays, Hashes include the Enumerable Module, which give users a great deal of power to iterate over and manipulate their hashes.</li>
      <li>Hashes values are accessed using the key.  For example, my_hash[key] would output the value associated with that key.</li>
      <li>Adding a new value to a hash is as simple as using the hash name, with the key name in brackets, and setting it equal to the value.  For example: my_hash[:key] = new_value.</li>
      <li>Hashes can be looped through using the .each method, which takes both key and value as arguments and applies a given code block to each pair.</li>
